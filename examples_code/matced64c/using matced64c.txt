Note regarding the use of matced64c.mexw64

- 64 bit mex file for Matlab to interface to use1432.

There is a tendency to use the same name for both
32 bit and 64 bit versions of programs, where they are
"compatible" (ie no additonal functionality specifically
for 64 bits is offered over the 32 bit version).  

CED have followed this for use1432.dll.  The version
dated 23 Nov 2013 is a 64 bit version, despite the name.
Although Win7 64 

The Matlab nomenclature is clearer.  I have chosen 
matced64c to indicate that this a compatible version,
so no 64bit-specific variables have been used.

matced64c.mexw64 should be put in a directory in the
Matlab path, along with use1432.dll version as supplied.

The mex file can be tested using the m files included,
namely mat1401X_64c.m, mat1401Xp_64c.m and mat1401TF_64c.m
and they show how you should call the mex interface and
how you should modify your existing m files.
