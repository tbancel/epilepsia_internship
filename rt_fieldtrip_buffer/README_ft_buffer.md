Readme folder rt_fieldtrip_buffer

- In this folder, I just play around to try to understand how the fieldtrip buffer works.
- The 4 files function_ft_** are just local copies of the called functions in the script that Xavier Navarro provided at the beginning.


- The folder example_code_xavier contains the script he sent me to stream a .eeg / .vhdr / .vmrk recording
- The other files of the folder contains my code to try to insert into the buffer.

The main problem is understanding how to use the binary buffer.
